# NeutralToken Specification

This repository defines the canonical specification for the **NeutralToken** protocol. The specification is divided into modular sections:

- [Core Protocol](core/overview.md)
- [Credential Profiles](profiles/jwt-basic.md)
- [Implementation Flows](flows/verifier_flow.md)
- [Security Considerations](security/threat_model.md)
- [Glossary](glossary.md)

Each section is versioned independently to ensure stability and allow future extensions.
