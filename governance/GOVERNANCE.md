# Governance – NeutralToken Protocol
Licensed under CC BY 4.0


The NeutralToken protocol is maintained under a foundation-led, open governance model.

## 🏛 Maintainer Roles

### NeutralToken Foundation (Nonprofit)
- Maintains the specification and open documentation
- Coordinates protocol evolution and community input
- Publishes official versions and credential profile standards
- Certifies compliant issuers and verifiers (optional)

### Ecosystem Participants
- **Issuers**: Entities issuing verifiable credentials using the spec
- **Verifiers**: Entities validating credentials offline
- **Wallet Providers**: Applications presenting credentials on users' behalf
- **Service Providers**: May offer hosting, SDKs, or other tools — but are not required or privileged

## 📋 Working Group

The Foundation facilitates a public working group to:
- Propose and review changes to the spec
- Draft new credential profiles or transport options
- Discuss privacy, legal, and technical improvements

Membership is open. Contact the Foundation to join.

## 📅 Releases and Versioning

- The protocol is versioned (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`)
- Credential profiles are modular and versioned independently
- Proposals follow an open RFC-style review and public comment process

## 🛡 Neutrality

The Foundation does not favor or endorse any single issuer or vendor. All ecosystem participants must comply with the open protocol to interoperate.
